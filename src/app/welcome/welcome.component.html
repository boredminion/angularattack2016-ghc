      <h3>Angle of Attack</h3>
      <p>In the distant future everybody has a spaceship. Fly around and shoot other ships and collect bounties or conduct peaceful mining and trade operations.</p>
      <h3>Movement</h3>
      <p>Your ship can move forward or turn. When a command is entered, there is a delay while your mighty engines turn the ship. If you issue another command, your previous order will be cancelled. To move forward press 'w' or 8 on your keypad (toggle your number lock). To turn press 'q' or 'e' or 7 or 9 on your keypad. You can also use the buttons on the screen.</p>
      <h3>Combat</h3>
      <p>If an enemy comes into range, fire away! It normally takes about ten hits to destroy an enemy but some ships have stronger hulls or weapons. Some weapons have longer range than others. To fire, press the spacebar.</p>
      <h3>Mining</h3>
      <p>When occupying the same tile as an asteroid, press the Mine button on your screen. You will extract valuable minerals from the asteroid and earn points. Asteroids have a limited amount of minerals available.<p>
      <h3>Trade</h3>
      <p>When occupying the same tile as a planet, press the Trade button on your screen. You will either pick up cargo or sell what you've got. You earn more points the farther you carry your cargo.</p>
      <h3>Bounties</h3>
      <p>Ships that attack peaceful traders will gain bounties that other ships can then collect by bringing the pirates to justice (grim space justice).</p>
      <h3>Upgrades</h3>
      <p>You can improve your ship in the shipyard by spending the points you've earned.</p>
      <h3>AI Ships</h3>
      <p>There are some AI ships flying around. The more players in the game, the more active the AI ships will be.</p>
      <h3>Scores</h3>
      <p>Something to brag about</p>
      <h3>Admin</h3>
      <p>Everything in Angle of Attack is parameterized and can be controlled from the admin panel. Some settings could cause problems for the game, such as adding 9999999999 planets so making changes is off limits for players.</p>
      <h3>Technology</h3>
      <p>We used Angular 2 RC1, RxJS 5.0.0-beta.6, angular-cli and Bootstrap 4.0.0-alpha.2.</p>
